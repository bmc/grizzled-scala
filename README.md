## Introduction

Grizzled Scala is a library of miscellaneous utility classes and objects.
Basically, whenever I find myself writing something that's general-purpose,
I put it in here, so I can easily use it in multiple projects.

The home page for the Grizzled Scala Library is
<http://software.clapper.org/grizzled-scala/>. Please see that page for
complete details, including installation instructions.

Grizzled Scala is copyright &copy; 2009-2018 [Brian M. Clapper][] and
is released under a new [BSD license](LICENSE.md).
